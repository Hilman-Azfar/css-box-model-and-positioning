# Box Model 

# Margin 
	- Margin denotes the space around the element
	- Allows us to move elements closer or farther from each other
	- moves relative to other elements
	- Always transparent
	- outside the element
	- If you give margin top/bottom to both parent and child element then only the margin property whose size is the greatest will be applied, this is called as margin collapsing (Note: This does not occur in case of float and absolute positioned elements)

# Border
	- Edge of the element
	- inside the element

# Padding & Content
	- Padding is the spacing between content and border
	- we can adjust this value to move the border closer or farther to the content
